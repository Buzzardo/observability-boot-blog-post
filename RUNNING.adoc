=== Running the samples

To run the samples:

. Start up the observability stack (for demonstration purposes, you can use the provided Grafana, Tempo, and Loki stack) and wait for it to start.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ docker-compose up
----
+
* To access Prometheus go to http://localhost:9090/
* To access Grafana go to http://localhost:3000/ (Grafana credentials: admin:admin)

. Run the server side application (this will block your current terminal window).
+
[source,bash]
----
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run -pl :server
----

. Run the client side application (this will block your current terminal window)
+
[source,bash]
----
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run -pl :client
----
+
You should see log statements similar to these:
+
[source]
----
2022-10-04T15:04:55.345+02:00  INFO [client,bbe3aea006077640b66d40f3e62f04b9,93b7a150b7e293ef] 92556 --- [           main] com.example.client.ClientApplication     : Will send a request to the server
2022-10-04T15:04:55.385+02:00  INFO [client,bbe3aea006077640b66d40f3e62f04b9,93b7a150b7e293ef] 92556 --- [           main] com.example.client.ClientApplication     : Got response [foo]
----

. Go to http://localhost:3000/[Grafana], go to dashboards, and click on the `Logs, Traces, Metrics` dashboard. There you can pick a trace ID value (for example, `bbe3aea006077640b66d40f3e62f04b9`) to find all logs and traces from both applications that correspond to that trace ID. You should see a following correlated view of logs and traces related to the same trace identifier, and you will see metrics taking place at the same time range. The metrics are related to HTTP request processing latency. These come from the automated Spring Boot WebMvc instrumentation that uses the Micrometer API.

Notice a diamond shape in the metrics. These are https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/basics/exemplars/[`Exemplars`]. Those are "`specific trace representative of measurement taken in a given time interval`". If you click on the shape, you can jump to the trace ID view to see the corresponding trace.

. Either click on the trace ID to `Query it with Tempo` or go to Tempo and pick the trace identifier yourself. You will see the following screen.

Each bar represents a `span`. You can see how much time it took for each operation to complete. If you click on a given span, you can see tags (key-value metadata) and timing information related to that particular operation.

This is how the correlated logs view would look in Loki.

If you want to see the `@Observed` annotated method metrics, you can go to the `Prometheus` view and find the `foo_metric` Timer.

If you want to see the metrics from your Observation that you have manually created, go to the `Prometheus` view and find the `my_observation` Timer.
